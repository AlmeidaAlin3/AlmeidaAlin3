### *Hello World, I’m Aline!*

<div class="home-text-left">
 
 As an engineer who grew up taking toys apart just to see how they worked, who has spent **4+ years in industry** building applied AI systems, and who holds a **Master’s in Deep Reinforcement Learning**, it’s genuinely uncomfortable *(and honestly a little embarrassing)* that I still can’t clearly say how AI systems *actually work* or claim that I truly understand what’s going on inside them.

When family and friends ask, *“Oh, you work with AI! Tell me how it works”*, it always hits me hard. They look at me expecting the gears to fall neatly into place. Instead, While answering I catch myself wondering whether the matrix multiplication thing has even fully convinced *myself*.

Over time, I realized this isn’t just a personal frustration. It’s something the field itself is starting to confront more openly, now framed as questions of **AI safety** and **AI misalignment**. I suspect the gap between performance and understanding is one of the risks we’re still underestimating.

I’m worried about what this gap could mean at a global scale with **potentially catastrophic implications**, but I’m also genuinely excited to take part in working toward better answers.

This [site](https://almeidaalin3.github.io/) is my attempt to gather my ideas, learnings, and experiments as I explore these questions. You can access and navigate it and, if you’d like, join me along the way.
