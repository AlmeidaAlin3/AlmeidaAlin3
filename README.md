‚Ä¢ ***What I've done:***
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; ‚àô &nbsp; [***Clusterization of AI-Synthesized Voices using Bispectral Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction:***](https://github.com/AlmeidaAlin3/AI-Synthesized_Voices_Clusterization) *A project that proposes the use of bispectral analysis and statistical tools to create features capable to show the differences between human and DeepFake voices. For more details, please refer to the [paper](https://github.com/AlmeidaAlin3/AI-Synthesized_Voices_Clusterization/blob/main/paper/Clusterization%20of%20AI-Synthesized%20Voices%20using%20Bispectral%20Analysis%20and%20Dimensionality%20Reduction%20-%20Aline%20Gabriel%20de%20Almeida%20.pdf), to the [notebook](https://github.com/AlmeidaAlin3/AI-Synthesized_Voices_Clusterization/blob/main/colab_notebook/Clusterization%20of%20AI-Synthesized%20Voices%20-%20Aline%20Gabriel%20de%20Almeida.ipynb) or to the [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkkUnHBzECo&ab_channel=AlineAlmeida).*  

&nbsp; &nbsp; ‚àô &nbsp; [***Stanford's Machine Learning Course:***](https://github.com/AlmeidaAlin3/MachineLearning/blob/master/README.md) *The Stanford's Machine Learning Course gave me a super solid mathematical foundation for Machine Learning! [Here](https://github.com/AlmeidaAlin3/MachineLearning/blob/master/README.md)'s my problem set solutions for the course.*
